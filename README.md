## Purpose
---
The purpose of this project is to make a weather station that will measure temperature, humidity, rain, light, and barometric pressure using a number of sensors. Data will be displayed on a LCD as well as stored onto computers
by using a WiFi module to communicate. A RTC will be used to measure the time measurements were made.
